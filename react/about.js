var body = <div>Artist Bio <br/><br/><div style={{textAlign: 'left'}}>Hello, my name is Madeline LeBarron. Ever since I was a little girl, growing up in Tucson Arizona, I have dreamed of becoming an artist. I would often try to teach myself how to draw by checking out all the art books in my school’s library. In high school I was heavily involved in my art classes and art clubs, there I learned animation and digital paintings skills. After graduating high school in 2014, I decided to pursue a degree in painting at Arizona State University. I am now graduating with my bachelors in the spring of 2018. After graduating I will be pursuing an art education degree and will another bachelor’s in art education.<br/><br/>In the painting program I have had many incredible professors who have educated me in both traditional and digital media. For my senior year I had the privilege of receiving a semi private honors studio space, in the ASU art building, to create my work. In February I was part of the Same as it Ever Was BFA show held at Gallery 100. <br/><br/>Currently I like to create digital and oil paintings the most. The main themes I showcase in my work are the complexity of family and thoughtfulness. I have always been drawn to painting old family photos, close friends and relatives. After I finish this body of work I would like to produce paintings about feminist issues and the beauty standards woman are held to.  Someday I hope to be on a creative team working on a feature length animated film. I also have this passion for teaching that I hope to explore as well. I want to collaborate and make work with others as well. <br/><br/>Over the years I have developed a beautiful semi realistic style that works well for conveying humor and emotion. I consider myself to be a proficient animator, uploading short animations to YouTube and slowly honing my skill in Adobe products. I have worked for The State Press, ASUs independent newspaper, as a cartoonist for over a year now and have published many graphics and even an independent cartoon series called Noodle and Shortcake. I am thrilled to be creating art and hope to continue making great pieces in the future.</div><br/><br/><br/> Artist Statement <br/><br/><div style={{textAlign:'left'}}>For me the human figure can be one of the most interesting and exciting subjects to paint. I love the challenge of trying to convey the complexity of human emotion and reality in my own way. I also love to incorporate. bright and intense colors into my work.<br/><br/>My most recent body of work captures my younger sister in moments of quiet wonder. I have always been perplexed by how different I am from my sibling and these paintings explore her in moments of detached thoughtfulness. We grew up together but at what moment do we diverge and grow as individuals. Her inner monologue in these moments is lost to time but these paintings offer an opportunity to guess and reflect on what she might be thinking in these stages of her life. <br/><br/> I like to capture my family members in these moments of detached thoughtfulness. For example, in the painting titled Red Couch my sister on the far left looks away from the viewer. Unlike the other two girls in the painting her imagination is being captured by something lost to time. I’ve always wondered about what people are thinking while concentrating on a specific thing or idea. My hope is that these paintings can convey this curiosity and mindfulness to the viewer. </div></div>;
